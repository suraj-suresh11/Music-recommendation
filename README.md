# Music Recommendation System using Python and Spotify API

## Overview

This project implements a music recommendation system using Python and the Spotify API. It provides personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening behavior. The system uses both content-based filtering and weighted popularity approaches to generate recommendations.

## How it Works

The recommendation system operates through the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Real-time music data is collected from the Spotify API, including tracks, albums, artists, and their attributes such as popularity, release date, and audio features.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The collected data is preprocessed to clean and organize it efficiently. This step involves handling missing values, normalizing features, and extracting relevant information.

3. **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommendations are generated based on the similarity of music features between the input song and other songs in the dataset. Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between songs.

4. **Weighted Popularity:** The system calculates a weighted popularity score for each song based on its release date and popularity. More recent releases are given higher weights.

5. **Hybrid Recommendations:** The final recommendations are generated by combining the content-based and popularity-based approaches. This hybrid approach provides more personalized and relevant recommendations.

## Getting Started

To use the music recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Spotify Developer Account:** Sign up for a Spotify developer account and obtain your client ID and client secret.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Code:** Run the Python script `music_recommendation.py` to generate music recommendations.

## Usage

The `music_recommendation.py` script provides functions to fetch music data from Spotify playlists, generate content-based recommendations, and create hybrid recommendations. You can customize the input song name and the number of recommendations to suit your preferences.

Example usage:

```python
input_song_name = "I'm Good (Blue)"
recommendations = hybrid_recommendations(input_song_name, num_recommendations=5)
print(f"Hybrid recommended songs for '{input_song_name}':")
print(recommendations)
